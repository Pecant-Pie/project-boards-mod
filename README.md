# Project Boards
*A Project Management mod for Minecraft*
## Summary
Project Boards is a mod that lets you organize projects by planning, starting, and finishing tasks using collections of Task Boards.

## Task Boards
You can place down Task Boards that will let you display text in the world.
These work a lot like Signs, but the text is stored in an item called a Task Slip.  
The name of the Task Slip item is what is shown on the Task Board.
You can right-click the task board with a Task Slip to swap it for the slip inside.
Empty Task Boards will not give you any task slip when you interact with them, the slip in your hand will just get inserted and the text will appear.
When you break a Task Board, the Task Slip inside will disappear. This is intentional, since placing the Task Board again will create a new blank one inside. 

## TODO for v0.1
- Add recipe for Task Boards
- UI for editing a Task by clicking on the task board with an empty hand
- UI for editing a Task by using a Task Slip in the air
- Text wrapping on Task Boards
- Buttons to start, finish, or restart a Task on the front of a Task Board
- Text displaying the status of a task: 'planned', 'started', or 'finished'
- Text displaying the 'owner' of a task (either the person who placed it, or the last person to start it or finish it)
- Item transfer support for Task Boards, so hoppers, droppers, and modded blocks can interact with them
